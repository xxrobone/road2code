Hi Robert, 

The links are fixed so I have no hestation in assessing your assignment as Välgodkänt. Well done!

I still see the transparent BG on the header, and the site appears to be lacking an indication in the menu of which page a user is currently on (hint: since each page has its own nav menu in the html you can add an "active" class to the relevant menu item on each specific page).

As said below, despite those small bugs the site is excellent.

Excellent work, Robert. I love how you aimed super high and delivered, it's abundantly clear that your web development knowledge is well beyond what is required for this class. You've got a heap of moving parts and there's nothing broken, great stuff. Although the content isn't assessable it's clear you've got a passion for this and I think you'll do really well. I don't think you could help my dancing, unfortunately!

I've sent you a message in teams chat regarding file paths. If you haven't received it please shoot me an email and I'll explain what is lacking.

Could you please fix those paths and let me know so I can reassess? I'll hold off a final grade until I see an update version on my local.
